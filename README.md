# WeatherWardrobe
This project measures how hot or cold it is outside to provide suggestions on what you should wear.

## Summary
I am building a two-part component; a temperature sensor that's wired up to an Arduino Uno board which reads how hot or cold it is, and a p5.js app that suggests outfits for you.

## Component Parts
- Adafruit Altimeter MPL3115A2
- Arduino/Genuino Uno Breadboard
- A few wires
- Digital app that converts temperature readings into outfit suggestions (WIP)


## Timeline
What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

Week 0: Write Proposal
Week 1: Source parts for project
Week 2: Got temperature sensor running to generate readings at 9600 baud (with Serial Monitor)
Week 3: 
Week 4: Present!


## Challenges
I'm proud of having set up Arduino to work the temperature sensor, but I'm not sure what platform I should use to call the measurements made and transform them into wardrobe suggestions.
